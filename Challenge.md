# Worker Code Challenge

## About

This coding challenge is about managing and scaling a 3rd party worker application in order to compute a sequence of random numbers within a defined time constraint.

## Challenge Goals

The goal of the challenge is to see how would you approach a problem, break it down and design a solution for it. That being said, here’s some expected goals to be achieved:

- Document your proposed solution
- Good and understandable code architecture
- A clear work history (Please use Git)
- Well documented code
- Well tested code

## What will you build

We would like you to write a program that uses the enclosed worker binary to compute 150 data samples. Your program needs to spawn and manage multiple worker (child) processes. The worker provides a http streaming interface to provide the computed numbers with a throughput of 1 rnd/sec. You can have only one connection per worker. A worker might crash after some time.

### Expectation

- write a component to manage the worker processes
- handle the http connections and consume the generated numbers
- collect a total amount of 150 data samples
- compute the total count of numbers you processed
- compute the total time spent
- [optional] scale the system to compute 150 numbers within 10sec
- [optional] scale the system with a max of 16 workers

### The Worker

The worker can be find enclosed (`bin/worker`), it's a compiled go application.

### Start

`./worker -workerId 1 -port 3001`

### API

`http://localhost:3001/rnd?n=100`
`http://localhost:3001/rnd?n=1`

`n` defines the number of random numbers the worker will generate.

The endpoint has a throughput of 1 rnd/sec. It's a chunked http stream.

Example Response

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: no-cache
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/text
X-Worker-Id: 1
Date: Wed, 28 Aug 2019 21:30:01 GMT
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

rnd=97
rnd=18
rnd=21
rnd=95
rnd=33
```

## Implementation Technology

- Python

Please feel free to use any framework, or no-framework.

## Completion Time

Within a maximum of 7 Days.

## Delivery

Please provide access to your code through a Github, GitLab or a BitBucket repository.
